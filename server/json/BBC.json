Two-thirds of these come from Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nKent-based AG Recruitment and Management works in Romania to supply labour for 80 growers across the UK.\n\nOver the next few months it needs to find 4,000 people to pick strawberries, raspberries, and eventually apples and pears. The agency is nowhere near that target, and is having to call farmers to say it will not have enough pickers for them.\n\nAccording to co-director, Estera Amesz, the numbers of people wanting to work in Britain fell sharply after Brexit. A key issue was the fall in the value of the pound. She says it is also down to the uncertainty; people aren't sure what documents they now need.\n\n\"We used to have queues outside our office in Bucharest. Thirty to 40 people would come a day. Now, on a good day, it's a handful. We used to take the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. Now, we are scraping the barrel.\"\n\nThe firm runs criminal history checks and the candidates do dexterity tests, but Mrs Amesz says her company has had to widen the net. She says she now considers those that, \"have two hands and two legs, and stand a 50% chance of making it\".\n\nRather than people coming to the company offices, they now have to travel deep into the Romanian countryside to sell the idea of coming to work in the UK.\n\nAt one presentation in the tiny village of Barlad, close to the border with Moldova, 30 people turn up, but only five sign up.\n\nAlina Stan, 31, decides to make the journey. She has come to the UK before to pick flowers and fruit. With the money, she's building a house for her and her family. But as soon as she can, she'll stop coming. She says: \"We hope in the next two years to be able to finish our home. But leaving my children behind is very difficult.\"\n\nAccording Doug Amesz, Estera Amesz' husband and business partner: \"We need an incentive. Previously we were looking for people with some English, now we find it difficult to recruit anyone with English.\"\n\nRomania is one of the poorest countries in Europe. It is one of the largest recipients of EU money.\n\nHowever, almost 30 years after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the fall of the communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, its economy is growing at 6.9%. That's almost three times the rate of Britain's.\n\nIt's creating a newly wealthy middle class.\n\nIn Iasi, Romania's second city, young people say they have no intention of picking fruit.\n\nPuiu Jonut, 23, studies geography.\n\n\"The English pick and choose what they want to do and leave the harder jobs for the foreigners,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"There are a lot of English people that could work the fields and not let the fruit rot.

Of the rest, 2,332 - 13% of the total - had been made redundant and the remaining 3,000 were still employed by Carillion.\n\nThe NAO said the Â£148m estimated loss was subject to a range of uncertainties, such as the timing and extent of asset sales.\n\nHowever, it would be covered by money already provided by the Cabinet Office to help finance the costs of liquidation.\n\nAlmost all services provided by Carillion continued uninterrupted after the firm's collapse, although work on some construction projects stopped, including building work on two hospitals funded by Private Finance Initiatives, the NAO said.\n\nCarillion's non-government creditors were unlikely to recover much of their investments, the NAO said.\n\nIn addition, the firm's extensive pension liabilities, which amounted to Â£2.6bn at the end of June last year, would have to be compensated through the Pension Protection Fund.\n\nThe head of the NAO, Amyas Morse, said the government had \"further to go\" in protecting the public interest in cases such as Carillion.\n\nHe added: \"Government needs to understand the financial health and sustainability of its major suppliers and avoid creating relationships with those which are already weakened.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Cabinet Office said the government's priority was to ensure public services provided by Carillion continued to run smoothly and safely.\n\n\"The plans we put in place have ensured this, and we continue to work hard to minimise the impacts of the insolvency, having safeguarded over 11,700 jobs to date,\" he said.\n\nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said: \"The government's dogmatic commitment to the failed outsourcing ideology blinded it to the large risks.

Here's how it's still making an impact.\n\nThe Sex and the City outfits are so iconic they're practically another character in their own right.\n\nBut fashions have changed a huge amount since we first saw the famous foursome, however, as this picture taken at the New York premiere of the very first episode shows.\n\nCostume designer Patricia Field worked with the show to create many of its classic looks - including that aforementioned tutu, teamed with a fur coat and heels, which has been described as \"an ensemble rich in cultural resonance\".\n\nVivienne Westwood designed Carrie's wedding dress, which she almost-but-not-quite married Mr Big wearing. It's now being displayed at the designer's New York store to mark the 10th anniversary of its creation.\n\nThen there were the accessories - Carrie's name necklace launched a trend that still continues today (as well as proving a pivotal plot point).\n\nAnd her love of footwear was such that Mr Big, played by Chris Noth, proposed not with a ring, but with a shoe.\n\nThey've even inspired their own Instagram account.\n\nThe good, the bad and the downright ugly are all captured in the Every Outfit on Sex and the City account, so we can relive each item in all its glory - including this colourful Samantha combo, which was likened to a tube of mascara.\n\nAside from the four main stars, a host of actors featured on Sex and the City - many of them getting their big break.\n\nKat Dennings, now best known for 2 Broke Girls, was 14 when she played precocious teenager Jenny Brier, who wanted Samantha to plan her bat mitzvah. It's her first role listed on IMDB.\n\nAlso unknown at the time he starred in SATC was Bradley Cooper, who had a few lines in the second season. The Hollywood actor starred as Jake, who shows Carrie an unflattering magazine cover picture of herself in They Shoot Single People, Don't They?\n\nIn the third series, John Slattery - now best known for his role in Mad Men - played Bill Kelley, a politician who briefly dates Carrie.\n\nOrange is the New Black's Michelle Hurst, who plays Miss Claudette in the prison comedy-drama, was a doctor in an episode where Samantha takes an STD test.\n\nJustin Theroux was a guest on the show not once, but twice - as a hotly-tipped writer called Jared in season one, and then as Carrie's boyfriend Vaughn in the second season.\n\nWithout Sex and the City, we might never have had several other shows which were inspired by the hit series.\n\nUS sitcom Girlfriends centred on a group of four women forging friendship and careers - there are definite similarities, but while SATC was accused of being too white, the four leads in Girlfriends were all African-American.\n\nLena Dunham's Girls centred on a group of twenty-something women in New York finding their way through work and relationships, so there were inevitable comparisons.\n\nDunham said it was \"bridging a gap\" between the teens in Gossip Girl and the 30-somethings in SATC - with the pilot intentionally featured a Sex and the City joke to make it clear that the girls were inspired by Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte.\n\nAnd of course, there was The Carrie Diaries, the 2013 series showing Carrie's life in the 1980s.\n\nThey're just as funny and meaningful today as they were back in the day.\n\nHere are a few which are just about safe enough for us to print.\n\nAnd of course then there's Woke Charlotte. The meme that keeps on giving.\n\nThe concept came from Lauren Garroni and Chelsea Fairless, the creators of Every Outfit on Sex and the City, mentioned above.\n\nIt cleverly deals with those awkward moments in beloved old shows that make us cringe over lines that are dated, out of touch or - dare we say it - a little offensive.\n\nThe meme takes problematic lines from the show, and then uses Charlotte as a mouthpiece to give a suitably up-to-date response.\n\nBravo, Charlotte! Now, if only her character had been quite so outspoken on the show...\n\nSATC fans are fierce and they're not going anywhere. When the series ended in February 2004, thousands threw farewell parties dressed up as their favourite characters and drank a toast (with a Cosmopolitan or two, of course).\n\nWhen the first spin-off film premiered back in 2008, hundreds queued from the early hours to greet the Sex and the City stars in London's Leicester Square.\n\nMany fans asked the stars to sign bags and shoe boxes.\n\nOne said at screening that she was a big fan \"because you can relate to it\", adding: \"It's my Bible, we've all gone through the same problems the girls have. They all inspire me. We're not going to be satisfied with just one film.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, a sequel followed - although after being panned by the critics, it was probably one for hardcore fans only.\n\nThe foursome are still making waves 20 years on - the show's official Facebook page has more than 13 million followers. And there are several Sex and the City tours you can go on in New York - visiting haunts like the Magnolia Bakery to get cupcakes, and even getting to sit on Carrie's front stoop.","source":{"uri":"bbc.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"BBC News"},"eventUri":"eng-4014672","shares":{"facebook":7595},"wgt":7595},{"uri":"880750549","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-06-04","time":"15:16:00","dateTime":"2018-06-04T15:16:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.929411768913269,"url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-44360996","title":"Salah tackle turns up in law school exam","body":"The tackle which forced Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah to leave the pitch 30 minutes into the Champions League final last week has featured as a question in a law exam, it's been reported.\n\nSyrian pages on Facebook circulated images from the General Penal Code exam sat by first-year students at the University of Damascus.\n\nThe question reads: \"Sergio Ramos injured Mohamed Salah in the 2018 European Champions League final.

He does not carry the Yashin name either, but he might just be able to ensure that the Yashin legacy lives on.\n\nVasily Frolov used to be a goalkeeper. He was on the books of Dynamo Moscow for a time, the only club Yashin represented. He is Yashin's grandson, and now he runs his own goalkeeper training school.\n\nWe meet on a modern, artificial turf pitch in a sports hall adjoining the stadium where his grandfather began his own career, playing for the factory team local to these northern fringes of Moscow - Tyshino. Over the road - a massive, 12-lane highway with no real markings to keep you in check - stands Spartak Moscow's new stadium, which will soon be hosting World Cup matches.\n\nVasily is wearing a T-shirt with white writing on a black background - \"Lev Yashin Style\". Four boys have turned up. He runs the young keepers through a series of drills. They are excellent. There is a lesson in each section, or more than one - communication, reflexes, positioning, throwing the ball.\n\nPyotr is 10 years old. He has turned up to training dressed all in black, even the palms of his gloves. He's not the only one either.\n\nTwo of his friends are decked out in black shorts, black under trousers and black long-sleeve tops. Pyotr has seen Yashin's matches on YouTube, watched his best saves, but he doesn't support Dynamo. I ask Vasily - is the black strip compulsory? Recommended? \"No,\" he answers. \"They just come like that.\"\n\nVasily joined Dynamo's youth side, having started out at Torpedo Moscow because it was closer to home. But he never made it. The closest he came to elite football was a loan spell with Dynamo St Petersburg, a sister club in the second tier, and he retired at the age of 23. Vasily's grandmother, Valentina, candidly says he wasn't good enough. Vasily agrees, and explains more. It was the mental burden he could not cope with.\n\n\"I can't say there was any external pressure or expectation on me, but there was internal pressure - the weight from the fact I had such a grandfather,\" he says. \"I wanted to show to everyone that I'm as good, but the level was so high that over time, with every mistake, there was an even more painful reaction. I understood that this could make me crazy and I needed to stop because my level became lower and lower. That's it.\"\n\nVasily has only one proper memory of his grandfather, but it is a happy one. He walks into a sunny bedroom, four years old, his head is as high as the mattress, and sees him lying there. He is beckoned to come closer and scrambles under the sheets.\n\nHe says: \"I remember realising that there was one leg and then nothing where the other should be, but I didn't pay much attention to it. I was just happy that my granddad invited me to be close to him. He covered me up with the blanket and it felt so good and so warm to be there next to him.","source":{"uri":"bbc.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"BBC

for dealing with hay fever","body":"Pollen levels are set to soar across parts of England and Wales over the next week, which means hay fever sufferers are in for a tough time.\n\nExperts are predicting that this year could see particularly high pollen counts because of recent rainfall followed by warm weather.\n\nSo what can be done to reduce hay fever symptoms?\n\nOne in five people in the UK is thought to suffer from hay fever, and the bad news is there's no cure for it and you can't prevent it.\n\nYou'll know if you're affected. It's the itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose that don't go away like a normal cold, often combined with headaches and tiredness.\n\nAfter you've been to your pharmacist or GP for advice on the best treatments, such as antihistamine tablets, drops or sprays, here are some other tips to try.\n\nCertain times of the day have higher pollens levels. On a typical high count day - dry, warm and sunny - at this time of year, the first half of the morning and later in the afternoon until late evening are the times to avoid being outside.\n\nBeverley Adams-Groom, pollen expert and forecaster from the University of Worcester, says pollen gets caught up in air currents and rises up away from nose level during the day.\n\nIf it's hot until much later in the day, particularly in cities in the south of the UK, then the risk of high pollen levels descending could continue all night.\n\n\"When it's very warm during the day, the pollen don't come down until the middle of the night, giving people a terrible night,\" she says.\n\nPollen is made up of fine, microscopic grains released into the air by grass, plants and trees. They are carried on the wind, easily inhaled by humans and pets, and they stick to everything.\n\nSo, it's a good idea to wash it all off once you get home after being outside - by:\n\nFor the same reason, you should avoid drying washing outdoors on a clothes line when the pollen count is high.\n\nThe pollen count is the amount of pollen per cubic metre measured over 24 hours at various places across the UK, using a trap with sticky paper inside it.\n\nA reading of between 50 and 150 grains of grass pollen is considered high - enough for hay fever symptoms to appear.\n\nThere's no excuse for not getting down to some housework if hay fever is an issue.\n\nVacuuming the house regularly and dusting with a damp cloth will help to prevent the pollen accumulating indoors and irritating your eyes and nose.\n\nWhile you're at it, keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n\nMake sure to monitor the Met Office's pollen forecast every day and for the five days to come so that you can stay indoors if possible when pollen counts are high.\n\nMost people with hay fever are allergic to grass pollen, but there are about 30 different types of pollen that can cause problems throughout the year.\n\nWhen it's warm, humid and windy, the pollen count is higher. Rainfall decreases pollen concentration in the air, particularly if it rains heavily in the morning.\n\nThe amount of daylight also plays a role - plants and trees will produce less pollen when it's cloudy.\n\nThe south of the UK is usually more badly affected by high pollen levels than other areas. For the next five days, the pollen count is forecast to be very high across England and Wales and low in Scotland and northern England.","source":{"uri":"bbc.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"BBC News"},"eventUri":"eng-4010509","shares":{"facebook":5418},"wgt":5418},{"uri":"880880126","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-06-04","time":"19:10:00","dateTime":"2018-06-04T19:10:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.7019608020782471,"url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44361613","title":"Strange twist of fate in US hit-and-run","body":"A Maine man killed by a hit-and-run driver on Friday himself killed a child in a hit-and-run five decades ago and cheated justice, it has emerged.\n\nDouglas Parkhurst, 68, was hailed as a hero after he died while pushing children from the path of the vehicle at a baseball field in Sanford.\n\nBut local media report he lied about killing a girl in a car crash in 1968.\n\nA 51-year-old woman was arrested in Friday's incident, which is apparently unconnected with Parkhurst's dark past.\n\nPolice are trying to determine why the suspect, Carol Sharrow, allegedly ploughed through a gate and drove wildly across the baseball park.\n\nSeveral players were on the field at the time and more than 200 people were in the stands.\n\nOne witness, Justin Clifton, told WCSH-TV: \"After the car got off the field, [the driver] came to the gate and the older guy pushed the kids right out of the way.\n\n\"He took the hit for the kid. We can't even have kids play baseball without someone getting hurt.\"\n\nParkhurst, a Vietnam veteran, was hit while trying to close a gate to keep the car in the field.\n\nMs Sharrow fled the scene and was later arrested. Police told local media she faces a preliminary charge of manslaughter.\n\nThey said she has a drink-driving conviction in two states, though did not confirm if alcohol was a factor in Friday's incident.\n\nParkhurst died on the way to the hospital.\n\nHalf a century ago, he was a prime suspect in the death of four-year-old Carolee Ashby one Halloween night.\n\nShe was thrown 133ft (40m) into the air when a car hit her while she was crossing the street.\n\nWitnesses said the impact was hard enough to launch the girl out of her black cowboy boots.\n\nCarolee had been walking with her 15-year-old sister to buy candles for a birthday cake.\n\nPolice received a tip-off that Parkhurst, then 18 years old, had apparently crashed a Buick into a pole that same night.\n\nThey interviewed him, but he denied any involvement in the hit-and-run.\n\nFive years ago, police reopened the cold case and questioned him again.\n\nThe local district attorney advised Parkhurst he could not be criminally charged for the accident because too much time had passed.\n\nParkhurst finally confessed to the crime in 2013, knowing the statute of limitations had expired and he could not be prosecuted.\n\nHe said he and his brother had been drinking before the accident.\n\n\"I don't remember seeing any kids but I believe in my heart I hit the little Ashby girl with my car.\"\n\nHe said his brother was passed out on the back seat of the car at the time of the collision.\n\nIn a Facebook post following the incident, the Sanford Maine Little League said all their players were safe.\n\nThey conveyed \"deep sorrow to the family of the brave man that gave his life tonight protecting others\".\n\nAfter hearing news of Parkhurst's death, Russ Johnson, the retired police officer who helped crack the Carolee Ashby case, told the Portland Press Herald: \"God works in mysterious ways.\n\n\"The secret Mr Parkhurst held all those years put that family through torment.\"\n\nHe

set for Heathrow runway decision","body":"Ministers will discuss whether to give the go-ahead for a new Heathrow runway on Tuesday, the BBC understands.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the economic sub-committee, chaired by Theresa May, is set to discuss the issue before it goes for approval by the full cabinet.\n\nIf backed, MPs would then be asked to vote on the issue in the coming weeks.\n\nThe government has backed expansion in principle despite opposition from key figures such as Boris Johnson.\n\nThe foreign secretary, who is MP for Uxbridge and Hillingdon in west London, has long been opposed to Heathrow expansion on both economic and environmental grounds while other critics include former education secretary Justine Greening, who also represents a London constituency.\n\nMinisters have accepted the recommendations of a 2015 review into airport capacity in the south-east of England which concluded that building a third runway at Heathrow offered the greatest economic benefits, as long as it was accompanied by a package of measures to address its environmental and community impacts.\n\nMinisters published a draft national airports statement in October setting out the conditions for its approval.\n\nParliament must approve the revised statement, which has since been subject to a public consultation, to allow the planning process to move onto
